# J(eb's) Blog

This is my Blog, powered by [@hexojs/hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) â€”â€” a fast, simple & powerful blog framework which is powered by Node.js. ðŸš€

And my theme is based on [@zchengsite/hexo-theme-oranges](https://github.com/zchengsite/hexo-theme-oranges). It's a simple theme, and I added some personal designs. You can refer to my [repository](https://github.com/JEB-Bem/hexo-theme-oranges) forked from hexo-theme-oranges.
